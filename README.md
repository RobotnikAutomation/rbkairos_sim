```


## Bringup

```

This launch files runs Gazebo and the ROS controllers to work with the RB-KAIROS robot. This launch accepts multiple parameters to work with.

By default it runs a full world with all the standard packages for navigation, localization and manipulation.

If you want to launch Moveit you have to run:


```
